# Default Registry Modifier
Default Registry Modifier is a simple GUI based tool made in Python using the Tkinter library. It pulls a list of registry keys from online JSON data & lists them with options for enabling or disabling them within the Default user's registry. All tweaks apply to new users upon creation after the use of this tool.
